### SCHEMA STRUCTURE:


## ANALYTICAL LAYER 

Here, we have created a datawarehouse where all the information from the perspective of constituency will be available. This includes information about where the constituency exists, the number of that constituency, the candidate who won from that constituency, the number of votes that are registered in that constituency, the number of votes that were cast, and the number of votes that were rejected. It will also provide information on the number of votes received by the individual who won that constituency. Lastly, it will tell the turnout percentage using the information available regarding the votes casted and votes that are registered.

## QUESTIONS TO ANSWER:

~~~~
1. The Party that won the most seats in the elections of 2018?
~~~~

~~~~
2. Voting Statistics: Total Number of Registered Votes, Total Number of Votes Casted, Total Number of Votes Rejected, Voter Turnout Percentage,
~~~~

~~~~
3. Party Popularity: Which party was the most popular one in the elections of 2018?
~~~~

### ETL PROCEDURE: 
As explained above, the analytical layer will be produced using the multiple tables and columns to have one denormalized structure that will then be used for analysis. 

#### Constituency - Consolidated Data:

### TRIGGERS:
Triggers are normally used to track changes in the database. The concept is to not only monitor the changes that have been made but also report the changes in form of a message. Triggers are also used to backup the data if new information is to be inserted. The following trigger is designed for the following:
	The voting statistics are considered provisional at times when the results are being tallied. This trigger is used to track the data if the information is changed. What it will do is if we change the voting numbers of a particular constituency, the trigger will give an alarm that the data was altered along with the timestamp. Additionally, the trigger will generate a backup file where it will put the previous information and store it for the future. In case of discrepancies with the data such as manipulation for political reasons, these two elements would be a good source of a proactiv measure.
